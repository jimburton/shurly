# shurly

This is a demo of using Spark with Velocity templates, with a lab exercise for students
on the CI346 module at the University of Brighton. The app is a 
simple URL-shortening service. The UI is a single web page with a 
form to submit URLs.

Fetch the code and compile it. You need to set up the database before
starting the app. It is expecting a MySQL database server running on
`localhost` and for which you have admin rights. If you are working on one
of the Linux boxes in the labs you can set this up with the script `db-uob.sql`. 
If you are working somewhere else, edit the file `src/main/resources/db.sql` to add 
the appropriate credentials.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jimburton/shurly
$ cd shurly
$ mvn compile
$ mysql -h localhost -u guest -pBr1ght@n < src/main/resources/db-uob.sql
$ mvn exec:java
```

This starts the Spark webserver, which will be serving the application at `http://localhost:4567`.

Read the first few parts of the Spark [Getting Started](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) 
guide, at least up to the section on the `Response` object. That should be enough of an
explanation of how Spark works for you to get an understanding of how the code works. 
Read the source code, starting with the `Application` class, which is the entry point. 

## Things to look out for when reading the code

+ The use of the config file, `src/main/resources/application.conf`,
and the way it is loaded in the `Application` class:

```
// in Application.java

public static void main(String[] args) {
  //Read in the config
  Config conf         = ConfigFactory.load();
  int port            = conf.getInt("web.port");
  // and so on...
```

+ The use of the lightweight data access framework `Sql2o` -- read
the `Application` class to see how it is set up, then the `Sql2oModel` class
to see it being used. Note that in `Sql2oModel` we use the Java 8 
[try-with-resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) feature
that makes sure the resources declared in the head of the `try` statement are automatically
closed for us:

```
// in Application.java

// Set up the DAO
Sql2o sql2o = new Sql2o(dbConnString, dbUser, dbPass);
model = new Sql2oModel(sql2o);

// in Sql2oModel.java

try (Connection conn = sql2o.open()) {
  List<ShurlyURL> result = conn.createQuery(
    "SELECT url FROM urls WHERE enc = :enc")
    .addParameter("enc", enc)
    .executeAndFetch(ShurlyURL.class);
```

+ The use of the template, `src/main/resources/templates/index.vm`,
and the way it is setup in the `main` method of `Application`. To pass data in to the template we
create a `Map` whose keys we can then refer to in the template:

```
// in Application.java

// set up the model for the template
final Map<String, Object> pageModel = new HashMap<>();
// store the data for the homepage in the template model
pageModel.put("HOME", HOME);
pageModel.put("ENC", enc);
// ...
return render(pageModel, indexPath);
            
// in index.vm

<a href="$HOME/$ENC"><span id="url_label">$HOME/$ENC</span></a>
```

## Exercise

At the moment our UI (a web page) is strictly for human consumption. Shurly would be a more useful
tool if we allowed other applications that need shortened URLs to use this application 
as a [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). A microservice architecture is 
one in which the components of a system are separate mini-applications in their own right, 
communicating with each other to achieve their goals. This can be an effective way to build 
scalable systems, as the component parts are very loosely coupled and it is easy to
dedicate more resources to the components that need it. Another advantage is that each component
can be written using the most appropriate programming language and tools without affecting any
other component.

We want the ability to submit a URL to be shortened and to receive the response as a JSON object.
We can do that by differentiating between requests based on the HTTP header `Accept`. If a `POST` 
request is made with `Accept` set to `text/html` we will serve the response as a web page, as we 
currently do. If a `POST` request arrives with `Accept` set to `application/json`, we should return 
the response as a JSON object. We can use `curl` to set the header and pass the form data:

```
$ curl -H "Accept: text/html" -d "the_url=http://brighton.ac.uk" http://localhost:4567/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
... etc
```

After you have added this feature you should be able to `POST` to the same address but ask for a
JSON response, making it possible for other applications to consume and use this data:

```
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -d "the_url=http://brighton.ac.uk" http://localhost:4567/
{ "status": "SUCCESS", "url": "http://brighton.ac.uk", "enc": "be6ce4cd" }
```

The `status` field should contain the error message if something went wrong:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -d "the_url=bananas" http://localhost:4567/
{ "status": "INVALID_URL" }
```

There are overloaded versions of the Spark methods to define routes (`get`, `post` and so on) that
take an extra argument specifying the content type that was requested:

```
get("/hello", "application/json", (request, response) -> {
    response.type("application/json");
    return "{\"message\": \"Hello World\"}";
});
```

Constructing the JSON ourselves, as in the example above, would quickly become fiddly for complex
objects. Our JSON objects will be based on instances of `ShurlyURL`, and we can use the 
[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library to transform instances directly to JSON. Add the Gson 
dependency to `pom.xml` (inside the `<dependencies>` tag with the other libraries that we're 
using):

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.2</version>
</dependency>
``` 

Now we can transform our POJOs to JSON objects as easily as this: `new Gson().toJson(pojo)`.

Change the existing `post` route in the `Application` class so that it is specialised for requests
with `Accept` set to `text/html`. Check that it still works as expected by encoding and 
following shortcuts to a few URLs in your browser.
 
Now you need to add a `post` route that is specialised for JSON. In this route you need to set the 
content type of the response using `response.type`. The structure will be something like this:

```
post("/", "application/json", (request, response) -> {
    response.type("application/json");
    
    // create and store the encoding as before
    // with the result in an instance of ShurlyURL called `result'
 
    return new Gson().toJson(result);
});
```

Note that the two `post` routes will share a lot of code, so once you've got this working you can 
create a helper method to remove duplication. Create a method in `Application` with this signature:

```
private static ShurlyURL handlePost(String theURL)
```

and put the code that looks up and optionally stores the URL in the database then constructs an
instance of `ShurlyURL` into `handlePost`. Call this method from both of the `post` routes.
